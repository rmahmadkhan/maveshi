A platform for cattle farmers which will allow them to digitize their cattle farm management. Currently, most of the farmers are using conventional paper diaries to write about their cattle and all the details about them. We aim to facilitate them by providing an app where farmers can make profiles of their animals and categorize them into types. Trying to facilitate them by adding details like milking and family tree.
